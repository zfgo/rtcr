# ray tracer

### Author: Zane Globus-O'Harra

This is my final project for CS 441: Introduction to Computer Graphics.
My goal is to implement a ray tracer such that it can render the 
following:

- spheres,
- mirrors (reflections),
- glass objects (refractions),
- multiple light sources,
- shadows,
- diffuse light (we'll see if we get there or not),
- etc.

My minimum goal is to create a scene with some sort of place as a floor
(perhaps the classic checkerboard), and to render a few spheres.
